# Islet Segmentation using SAM

After manual modification of ROI boxes, SAM is applying to all ROI boxes at once.


1. After selecting all the ROI boxes, open the **SAM API** extension
2. Press **Run for Selected**

3.Wait for the segmentation to finish

# Islet segmentation Advanced

1. Open one image
2. Go to **Classify** -> **Pixel classification** -> **Create Threshold**
3. create a new Threshold where the class is Islet and the 
   * Adjust properly the values where the majority of the islets are selected

4. Go through the image and remove non islet objects, create annotations for those islets using the previous method
5. Repeat steps 4-8 from the basic segmentation [this step will take time]

### As you can see, the output is not as good as the basic segmentation, but it is faster and can be used as a starting point for the basic segmentation
